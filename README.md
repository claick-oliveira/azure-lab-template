# Azure Lab Template

This project was built to create resources in Azure for labs. This template helps in setting up a scalable and secure network topology in Azure, which can be used for various lab environments. It includes predefined configurations for virtual networks, subnets, network security groups, and other essential Azure resources. By using this template, you can significantly decrease the setup time and accelerate your studies and proof of concepts (POCs), allowing you to focus more on learning and experimentation.
